# KiCad Development Script Information

## ⭐ USE THIS SCRIPT: dev-build.sh

This is the **ONLY** script you need for building and running KiCad on macOS.

### Quick Reference:

```bash
# Build and run (most common)
./dev-build.sh

# Just build
./dev-build.sh build

# Just run (skip build)
./dev-build.sh run

# Clean everything
./dev-build.sh clean

# Reconfigure CMake
./dev-build.sh configure
```

### Key Features:

✅ **Single build directory**: Always uses `build/release/` - no confusion!
✅ **Automatic configuration**: Sets up CMake on first run
✅ **Incremental builds**: Only rebuilds what changed
✅ **Runs from build dir**: No need to install, runs directly from build directory
✅ **Auto-detects CPU cores**: Uses optimal parallelism
✅ **Clear output**: Shows exactly what it's doing

### Build Directory:

- **Always uses**: `build/release/` (relative to repo root)
- **KiCad binary**: `build/release/kicad/KiCad.app/Contents/MacOS/kicad`
- **Never gets confused**: Always builds and runs from the same place

### Documentation:

See [BUILD_MACOS.md](BUILD_MACOS.md) for full instructions.

### Old Scripts:

- `setup-env.sh` - For Linux only (not macOS)
- `install-deps.sh` - For Linux only (not macOS)
- `build/release/run_kicad.sh` - Old script, use `dev-build.sh` instead
